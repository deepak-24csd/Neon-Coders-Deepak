# ⚡ Electricity Monitoring & Smart Dashboard

## 📖 Project Description
This project focuses on **monitoring and saving electricity in households** by tracking the regular usage of individual devices and updating the data in real time.  
The system not only visualizes consumption but also **automates appliance control** — turning devices on/off based on recorded usage patterns to minimize power consumption.  

Key highlights:
- Real-time electricity usage tracking
- Device-level monitoring
- Automated control for energy efficiency
- Prototype built with text input data (sensor integration planned)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (complete implementation)
- Developed and tested in **Visual Studio Code**

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions
Currently, the project runs directly via the provided link (no complex setup required).  
Future versions will include detailed installation and configuration steps.

---

## 📊 Features
- Real-time usage graphs
- Appliance-level breakdown
- Automated appliance control based on usage
- Energy-saving recommendations

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Integration of **IoT sensors** to monitor actual electricity consumption
